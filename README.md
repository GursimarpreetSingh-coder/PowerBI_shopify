# Shopify E-commerce Sales & Customer Funnel Dashboard

> An end-to-end Power BI portfolio project analyzing Shopify sales data to provide actionable e-commerce insights.

## üìä Short Description

This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze a Shopify e-commerce dataset. It visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales, customer behavior, and product performance, transforming raw sales data into an interactive, decision-driving report.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end proficiency in Microsoft Power BI. This includes:

* **Data Cleaning & Transformation** (using Power Query)
* **Data Modeling** (connecting data sources, though this project uses a single flat file)
* **DAX Measure Creation** (writing custom formulas for KPIs)
* **Modern Dashboard Design** (UI/UX, custom navigation, and interactivity)

This dashboard is designed to act as a portfolio piece, showcasing the skills required for a Business Intelligence or Data Analyst role.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools

* **Power BI Desktop:** The primary tool for report development.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating all custom measures (e.g., `Net Avg. Order Value`, `Repeat Customers`, `Retention Rate`).
* **Power Query (M Language):** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and loading the source data.

## üíæ Datasource

The data is sourced from a static **Excel file (`Shopify Sales.xlsx`)** containing anonymized transaction and customer data exported from a Shopify store.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Executive KPI Dashboard:** A high-level overview of critical metrics:
    * Total Sales & Transactions
    * Average Order Value (AOV)
    * Customer Purchase Frequency & Retention
* **Customer Funnel Analysis:** Visuals tracking the customer purchase journey and retention rates.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** An interactive map visual ("Regional Overview") to filter sales data by state/province.
* **Time Series Insights:** A "Total Qty Trend Over Time" line chart to identify sales patterns and seasonality.
* **Product & Payment Breakdown:** Bar and donut charts showing top-performing products and popular payment gateways.
* **Custom Page Navigation:** A sleek, app-like navigation panel (built from buttons and icons) to switch between the "Shopify Analysis" and "Details Tab" pages.
* **Drill-Through & Drill-Down:** The report allows users to click on a visual (like a city on the map) to drill down and filter the entire report page for specific insights.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

* **Modern UI/UX Design:** A clean, dark-mode theme with custom icons and buttons for a professional, app-like feel.
* **Complex DAX Measures:** The dashboard moves beyond simple sums, utilizing DAX to calculate meaningful business metrics like retention and repeat customer rates.
* **Data Storytelling:** The report is structured to guide a user‚Äîfrom the high-level summary on the main page to the granular data in the "Details Tab."
