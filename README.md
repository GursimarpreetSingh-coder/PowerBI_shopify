**Hospital Operations & Financial Performance Dashboard**

*End-to-End Power BI Analysis of Hospital ER Efficiency and Financial Metrics*

---

**Short Description**

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project analyzing patient flow, operational bottlenecks, and financial performance within a hospital's Emergency Room (ER) setting. It transforms raw patient visit and billing data into actionable insights for hospital administration.

---

**Purpose**

The primary goal of this project is to provide hospital management with a unified view of operational efficiency and financial health. Key objectives include:
* Identifying bottlenecks in patient wait times across different departments.
* Analyzing revenue generation by doctor and department.
* Understanding patient demographics and satisfaction drivers.
* Providing key performance indicators (KPIs) for executive oversight.

---

**Tech Stack Used**

* **Power BI Desktop:** For data transformation, modeling, DAX calculations, and report visualization.
* **Power Query (M Language):** For Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, including merging tables, cleaning data, and fixing data types.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated measures and KPIs (e.g., Average Wait Time, Total Revenue, Distinct Patient Count).

---

**Datasource**

The analysis is based on two primary CSV datasets:
1.  `Hospital ER.csv`: Contains anonymized patient visit details including timestamps, demographics, wait times, and department referrals.
2.  `Doctor_Patients_data.xlsx - Sheet1.csv`: Contains billing information linked to patient visits, including doctor details, appointment fees, and total bills.

*Note: These datasets are fictional or publicly available samples and do not contain real patient information.*

---

**Features**

* **Interactive Dashboard:** Multi-page report allowing users to filter and slice data dynamically.
* **Data Model:** Cleaned and merged data into a single `Visits` fact table for efficient analysis.
* **KPI Monitoring:** Key metrics like Total Patients, Total Revenue, and Average Wait Time are prominently displayed.
* **Departmental Analysis:** Visualizations comparing performance (wait times, revenue) across different hospital departments.
* **Doctor Performance:** Analysis of patient volume and revenue generation per doctor.

---

**Highlights**

* Successfully merged and cleaned data from two distinct sources using Power Query.
* Developed key DAX measures to derive meaningful insights beyond basic sums and counts.
* Created clear and actionable visualizations to address specific business questions regarding hospital operations and finances.
* Demonstrates an end-to-end BI workflow from raw data to interactive dashboard.
